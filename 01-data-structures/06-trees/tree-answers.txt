1.  Print both Trees to the console and compare the difference between your Binary Search Tree and your Heap.

2.  Insert all numbers from 1 to 100000 into both Trees, then use Benchmark to compare performance:



  How much time does an average insertion consume in the Binary Search Tree compared to the Heap?


  How much time does finding 50000 in the Binary Search Tree consume compared to the Heap?


  How much time does the average deletion consume in a Binary Search Tree compared to the Heap?


  When would you use a Binary Search Tree and why?


  When would you use an Heap and why?
